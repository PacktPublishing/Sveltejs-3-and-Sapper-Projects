﻿# Svelte.js 3 and Sapper Projects
This is the code repository for Svelte.js 3 and Sapper Projects. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
	
This course will take you through three core projects to help you build effective, reactive, and attractive apps with Svelte, demonstrating its intrinsic benefits, including less code and impressive reactivity/state management along the way.

Our first project, a vCard generator app, will demonstrate the modularity and reactivity web applications you can develop with Svelte. We will build reusable and dynamic components that we will later enhance with more advanced features. Sections on animation and transitions are included to make applications look as good as they perform!

Our second project will be a fully functional Kanban board application, similar to Trello. This application will also have effective state management, by making use of stores and other key Svelte features.

Our final application will be based on the previous Kanban board application but making use of Sapper, the official Svelte framework. We will learn how to create web apps with Sapper and master its most useful features, such as routing and preloading.

We will also provide an introduction to testing Sapper applications with Cypress, and we finish the course by deploying our application in two different ways: as a static page, and as an SEO-optimized server-side rendered (SSR) application.
